# üìö Core API Overview

M7BootStrap exposes a small set of primary methods for loading, unloading, and managing runtime packages.
This section provides a high-level overview; for detailed usage, see the dedicated sections for each method.

---

## `constructor(netInstance)`

Creates a new bootstrapper tied to a given network instance (e.g., `m7Fetch`).

```js
import Net from "./vendor/m7Fetch/src/index.js";
import BootStrap from "./vendor/m7Bootstrap/BootStrap.js";

const net = new Net();
const bootstrap = new BootStrap(net);
```

**Parameters:**

* `netInstance` ‚Äî An initialized network/fetch system used for retrieving packages and assets.

---

## `async load(resources, options?)`

see **[Loading Packages](LOADING_PACKAGES.md)** for information on loading packages.

Loads one or more packages, resolving dependencies, fetching resources, and executing mount hooks.

**Parameters:**

* `resources` ‚Äî Single resource or array of packageResource inputs (string, object, inline package).
* `options` *(optional)* ‚Äî include load , error to run handlers.
  * load, error (optional)* ‚Äî Handler(s) to run on success or failure. Can be:
    * Function
    * Global function name as string
    * Symbolic reference `"@pkg.module.fn"`
    * Local bootstrapper method reference (e.g., `"#runner.mount"`)
  * `package.hooks` (boolean) ‚Äî Run `run` hooks in loaded packages (default: `true`).

**Returns:**

* `BootStrapLoadReport` - report.success
  * if all packages loaded successfully, true
  * if any packages failed , false

---

## `async unload(ids, onDone?, onFail?, options?)`

Unmounts and clears loaded packages.

**Parameters:**

* `ids` ‚Äî Array of package IDs or objects with `.id`.
* `onDone` *(optional)* ‚Äî Handler(s) to run after successful unload.
* `onFail` *(optional)* ‚Äî Handler(s) to run if unload fails.
* `options` *(optional)*:

  * `ignoreMissing` (boolean) ‚Äî Skip errors if package not found.

---

## `bootstrap.mount.load(pkgID,options?)`

Mounts a given package. if that package is already loaded, it will not be reloaded.
use options.force to force mount a package that is already loaded.

---
## `bootstrap.mount.unload(pkgID,options?)`

Unounts a given package 

---

## `async buildDependencyGraph(resources)`

Given one or more packageResource inputs, resolves all dependencies recursively and returns a flat, ordered list of package definitions ready to be loaded.
This is mainly useful to testing, otherwise there is no need to build a dependency graph on your own.

---


## `data`

All loaded data is stored within the PackageData Object. this may be accessed via a variety of methods , or directly.
